# Interactive Map Junk

Subscribe to clutter the wide-open maps of Brotato with Interactive Map Junk. By default, one of six objects will be randomly selected to spawn on the map, at the beginning of 66% of waves (spawn/wave rate can be adjusted with settings in the Options-Mods menu), and at a randomized map location. Each object has unique traits that can be exploited to develop new strategies for conquering enemies and surviving waves. E.g., one object is a stationary abandoned vehicle, which, by restricting player and enemy movement, can change the flow of waves, while another object is a big moveable teddy bear that can be pushed around and used for cover (from enemy contact, not projectiles). Settings in the Options-Mods menu, including the ability to turn the mod on/off, can be adjusted at any time. If settings are changed during a wave, then they will take effect on the following wave. Without Interactive Map Junk, when enemies get thick, and your build is suffering, sometimes the only way to survive is to run laps around the perimeter, which can get boring. Interactive Map Junk can remedy this a bit and keep things interesting, while not making survival too easy or even that much easier. Enjoy the junk!
